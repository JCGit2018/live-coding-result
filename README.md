# Live Coding

At B9lab, we did a live-coding in order to show one way, ours, of creating a small DApp, with a student from our [Ethereum Developer July 2016 cohort](https://academy.b9lab.com/dashboard).

The video is [found there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFyxMASJpnw), and what you get here is the code at the end. Unvarnished.
